Title: A Faster ARFF File Reader and Writer
Description: Reads and writes 'ARFF' files. 'ARFF' (Attribute-Relation File Format) files are like 'CSV' files, with a little bit of added meta information in a header and standardized NA values. They are quite often used for machine learning data sets and were introduced for the 'WEKA' machine learning 'Java' toolbox. See <http://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF> for further info on 'ARFF' and for <http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/> for more info on 'WEKA'. 'farff' gets rid of the 'Java' dependency that 'RWeka' enforces, and it is at least a faster reader (for bigger files). It uses 'readr' as parser back-end for the data section of the 'ARFF' file. Consistency with 'RWeka' is tested on 'Github' and 'Travis CI' with hundreds of 'ARFF' files from 'OpenML'.
